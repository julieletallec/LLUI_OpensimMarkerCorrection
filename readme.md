### 📄 `01_translate_markerset.ipynb`
#### ✅ What This Notebook Does

This notebook simulates the use of a **different marker set** by:

1. **Scaling** an OpenSim model using a C3D calibration file and the original markers.
2. Running **Inverse Kinematics** (IK) on both calibration and dynamic trials with the original marker set.
3. Running **Point Kinematics** using a **new marker set** on the IK results.
4. Saving the resulting `.trc` files and converting them to `.c3d` files with embedded force/analog data.

> 🔄 This simulates marker placement variation or alternative setups, useful for validation, robustness testing, or sensor configuration evaluation.

#### 🎯 Goal & Outcome

- **Goal:** Generate new `.trc` and `.c3d` files representing the motion as if it had been captured using a different marker configuration.

### 📄 `03_correct_marker_displacement_15_days.ipynb`
#### ✅ What This Notebook Does

This notebook performs **marker displacement correction** across 15 days of repeated calibration trials by:

1. Converting each day’s calibration `.c3d` file into a `.trc` file.
2. Averaging all 15 `.trc` files to produce a single, stable calibration marker configuration.
3. Scaling an OpenSim model using the averaged calibration file.
4. Using this corrected model to re-run **Inverse Kinematics** and **Point Kinematics** on each dynamic trial.

## 📁 TEST_PIPELINES
### 📄 `01_test_caren_simulated_displacements.ipynb`

#### ✅ What This Notebook Does

This notebook **simulates and evaluates marker displacement scenarios** using motion capture data recorded with the CAREN system. It performs a **systematic validation** of the correction pipeline by:

1. **Generating Ground Truth Data**
   - Uses unaltered markers to scale a model, compute joint angles (`.mot`) and marker trajectories (`.trc`) using OpenSim.
   - Ground truth `.trc` and `.mot` files undergo the exact same processing as displaced and corrected files to ensure fair comparison.

2. **Simulating Marker Displacement**
   - Simulated displacements are **not synthetically applied** but are instead **recorded using additional physical markers** placed near the true anatomical landmarks.
   - These displaced markers are present in the original `.c3d` files and follow a naming convention like:
     - `RASIS0`, `RASIS90`, `RASIS180`, `RASIS270`
     - where the suffix indicates the **directional offset** (e.g., 90° = anterior)
   - 15 unique displacement combinations are defined and tested by selecting different versions of these displaced markers.

3. **Correction via Averaged Calibration**
   - A model is built using the average of all 15 displaced calibration trials.
   - It is then used to correct the dynamic trials and generate **corrected `.trc` and `.mot` files**.
   - These are compared against both the displaced and ground truth versions using RMSE and statistical testing.

> 🎯 This notebook is used to **quantify how displacement affects kinematic analysis**, and how effective the correction process is in recovering ground truth.


#### 🎯 Goal & Outcome

- **Goal:** Assess and visualize the effects of marker displacements on gait analysis, and evaluate how correction improves results.
- **Outcome:** 
  - 15 displaced and 15 corrected marker/joint angle files (`.trc`, `.mot`)
  - Ground truth reference files
  - RMSE & statistical analysis (marker-level and joint-level)


#### 📂 Requirements to Run

- A calibration `.c3d` file containing **both ground truth and displaced markers**
- A dynamic walking `.c3d` trial with the same marker layout
- A `.csv` gait events file aligned to the dynamic trial
- OpenSim musculoskeletal model and marker set (`.osim`, `.xml`)
- A scaling setup template (`.xml`)

#### 🔧 Changeable Parameters

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SUBJECT` | Participant identifier | `"Mathieu"` |
| `N_CYCLES` | Number of gait cycles to include | `10` |
| `N_COMBOS` | Number of marker displacement configurations to evaluate | `15` |
| `MARKERS_WITH_DISPLACEMENT` | Markers with multiple placed versions (displaced) | `["RASIS", "LASIS", "RPSIS", "LPSIS"]` |
| `MARKERS_WITHOUT_DISPLACEMENT` | Markers placed only once (ground truth only) | `["LLTHI", "LHEE", ..., "T10"]` |
| `COMBOS` | List of marker combinations to use for each displacement trial | `[['RASIS90', 'LASIS0', ...], ...]` |
| `KINEMATICS` | Joint angles to track and compare | `["hip_flexion_r", "pelvis_tilt", ...]` |
| `RESULTS_FOLDER` | Folder to store all outputs | `"test_caren_displacements_Mathieu"` |


#### 🔁 Adapt for New Experiments

To use this notebook with a **different experimental setup**, you only need to update a few key parameters:

- **Change which markers are considered displaced** by editing `MARKERS_WITH_DISPLACEMENT`.
- **Adjust the marker combination sets** via the `COMBOS` list.
- **Replace `.c3d` and marker set files** if working with a new subject or setup.
- Optionally, change `KINEMATICS` if evaluating different joint angles.

This makes the pipeline **fully reusable** for testing other marker placements, participant configurations, or perturbation strategies.


### 📄 `02_test_opensim_displacements.ipynb`
#### ✅ What This Notebook Does

This notebook **predicts and evaluates the impact of marker displacements** using **fully virtual simulations in OpenSim**. Unlike the CAREN-based study (see `01_test_caren_simulated_displacements.ipynb`), this pipeline simulates displacements by modifying marker definitions and using **OpenSim's PointKinematics** tool—no additional physical markers or modified `.c3d` files are required.

> 💡 This is ideal for **designing or pre-evaluating experimental setups** *before* conducting real trials. You can test how displacing specific markers affects kinematics, and estimate correction outcomes in advance.

The pipeline is organized in 4 main parts:

1. **Ground Truth Generation**
   - Derives clean `.trc` and `.mot` data from calibration and walking `.c3d` trials.
   - Uses **double PointKinematics** steps to ensure consistency and comparability with displaced/virtual data.

2. **Simulated Marker Displacements**
   - Marker displacements are simulated by modifying marker definitions in the marker set XML.
   - No physical recording of displaced markers is needed—their positions are **simulated from joint angles** using OpenSim.

3. **Correction with Averaged Calibration**
   - All displaced calibration trials are averaged to create a "neutral" model.
   - This model is then used to correct the walking trials, producing "corrected" `.trc` and `.mot` outputs.

4. **Evaluation**
   - Displaced and corrected results are compared against ground truth in terms of **marker trajectories** and **joint angles**, using RMSE.


#### 🎯 Goal & Outcome

- **Goal:** Predict how virtual displacements of anatomical markers affect motion analysis and assess the effectiveness of model-based correction.
- **Outcome:** 
  - 15 displaced and 15 corrected `.trc` and `.mot` files
  - Ground truth versions generated under comparable conditions
  - Per-marker and per-kinematic RMSE evaluations before and after correction


#### 🤖 How Displacements Are Simulated

- Markers like `"RASIS"` or `"LLEK"` are redefined with **virtual positional offsets** in the OpenSim marker set XML.
- These offsets simulate displacements of **10–20 mm** in anterior, posterior, medial, or lateral directions.
- The simulation uses:
  - **`deplacer_markers()`** to update marker definitions
  - **OpenSim's `PointKinematics`** to compute virtual marker trajectories from `.mot` files


#### 📂 Requirements to Run

- Original `.c3d` calibration and walking files containing **only ground truth markers**
- A gait event file aligned with the dynamic trial
- OpenSim musculoskeletal model and marker set (`.osim`, `.xml`)
- A scaling setup template (`.xml`)


#### 🔧 Changeable Parameters

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SUBJECT` | Participant identifier | `"Mathieu"` |
| `N_CYCLES` | Number of gait cycles to include | `10` |
| `N_COMBOS` | Number of marker displacement configurations to simulate | `15` |
| `MARKERS_WITH_DISPLACEMENT` | Markers to simulate displacement on | `["RASIS", "LLEK", "LMM", ...]` |
| `KINEMATICS` | Joint angles to track and compare | `["hip_flexion_r", "pelvis_tilt", ...]` |
| `RESULTS_FOLDER` | Folder to store all outputs | `"test_opensim_displacements_Mathieu"` |


#### 🔁 Adapt for New Experiments

To use this notebook for other experimental contexts or hypotheses:

- **Change the displaced markers** by updating `MARKERS_WITH_DISPLACEMENT`.
- **Modify displacement logic** inside `deplacer_markers()` to simulate different magnitudes or directions.
- **Adjust the number of combos or gait cycles** to match your validation needs.

> 🛠 This pipeline is fully modular and allows easy adaptation for future pilot testing or protocol development.


### 📄 `03_test_quantification_of_model_displacements.ipynb`

#### ✅ What This Notebook Does

This notebook evaluates **multi-day calibration consistency** across several StimuLOOP patients by comparing the marker positions obtained from daily static trials with those from a **single averaged (corrected) model**.

The calibration `.c3d` files from 16 training days are converted to `.trc`, aligned, and then averaged to generate a representative, corrected calibration. The **marker displacement error** between the daily calibrations and this averaged model is then analyzed.

> 📊 This analysis is useful to understand how much calibration variation occurs in real-world, longitudinal data collection, and whether a single averaged model might be a more robust reference.


#### 🎯 Goal & Outcome

- **Goal:** Quantify marker position variability across 16 sessions and evaluate the feasibility of replacing per-day scaling with a single averaged calibration.
- **Outcome:** For each patient:
  - One `.trc` file representing the averaged static calibration
  - 16 individually scaled calibration files
  - Marker-wise and day-wise displacement plots against the averaged model


#### 🔬 What’s Being Analyzed

- For each patient:
  - 16 daily `.c3d` calibration files (T0–T15)
  - Converted to `.trc`, then **aligned segment-wise** (based on each anatomical segment’s local marker CoM)
  - Averaged into a **single `.trc` file**
  - Used to scale a "corrected" OpenSim model
  - Marker distances between each individual day and the averaged model are computed and plotted


#### 📂 Requirements to Run

- Folder structure like: `stimuloop patient data/S001/CalibrationT0.c3d` ... `CalibrationT15.c3d`
- 16 static calibration trials per patient
- OpenSim model and marker set
- A scaling setup XML template


#### 🔧 Changeable Parameters

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DATA_FOLDER` | Location of StimuLOOP patient `.c3d` data | `"stimuloop patient data"` |
| `RESULTS_FOLDER` | Where all outputs and plots are saved | `"stimuloop_displacement_error_results"` |
| `N_DAYS` | Number of calibration days to process | `16` |
| `MARKERS` | Marker list used for analysis and alignment | `[“LASIS”, “RASIS”, ...]` |
| `PATIENT_ID` | ID of patient for single-patient evaluation | `"S001"` |


#### 👨‍⚕️ Two Modes of Operation

1. **Batch Mode (All Patients):**
   - Automatically processes every patient folder in `DATA_FOLDER`
   - Skips any with missing `.c3d` files

2. **Single Patient Mode:**
   - Manually specify `PATIENT_ID`
   - Useful for debugging or visualizing a single case


#### 📈 What You Get

- 16 aligned `.trc` calibration files per patient
- 1 averaged `.trc` calibration file per patient
- 1 scaled model based on the average
- 📊 Two diagnostic plots:
  - **Per-marker RMSE across days** (boxplot per marker)
  - **Per-day RMSE across markers** (boxplot per day)


#### 🔁 Adapt for New Studies

You can easily adapt this pipeline for:

- A different number of calibration sessions (e.g., `N_DAYS = 5`)
- Different marker sets (`MARKERS`)
- Custom alignment strategies (`non_rigid=True`, `recenter_strategy="pelvis"`)

> 🧪 This pipeline is ideal for analyzing inter-session consistency or designing protocols where per-day recalibration is to be minimized.

## 📁 example_c3d_files
This folder contains example **C3D files** used throughout the project.

C3D is a standard file format in motion capture that contains:

- **Marker trajectories** (3D positions of markers over time)
- **Force plate data** (ground reaction forces, moments, and center of pressure)
- **Analog signals** (optional, not always used)

We use two types of C3D trials:

- **Calibration trials** — static poses used to scale the musculoskeletal model
- **Dynamic trials** — motion trials (e.g., walking) used to compute joint kinematics

➡️ These `.c3d` files are **always converted to `.trc` format** (marker trajectories only) for processing in OpenSim.

### 🔍 What’s typically used?

- Marker trajectories for inverse and point kinematics
- Force plate data for later integration with `.trc` or `.mot` files (optional)

⚠️ Make sure your own C3D files include the necessary **marker labels** expected by the scripts and the **force data**, especially for dynamic trials.

---
## 📁 example_gaitevents_files
These files contain **gait event timings** extracted from the motion capture trials (e.g., heel strikes, toe-offs).

They are used to:

- Automatically detect and extract a given number of gait cycles (e.g., first 10 cycles)
- Define the **start and end times** of the dynamic trials used in Inverse and Point Kinematics
- Ensure synchronized comparisons across ground truth, displaced, and corrected motion

### 📋 Structure

Each `.csv` file typically includes:

| Time (s) | Event         |
|----------|---------------|
| 1.23     | RHS (Right Heel Strike) |
| 2.45     | LHS (Left Heel Strike)  |
| ...      | ...           |

Only the **Time** column is usually used in scripts that extract the number of gait cycles (`N_CYCLES`), by selecting the first `2 * N_CYCLES` rows.

### 🛠️ What Can Be Modified?

- You can **replace the file** with gait event data from other subjects or trials.
- The only requirement is that the file must contain **chronologically ordered timestamps** of heel strikes.
- Additional event labels are ignored by most scripts.

⚠️ If your file structure differs (e.g., includes headers, extra columns, or different event labels), make sure to **adapt the code** that reads it accordingly.

---
## 📁 example_marker_files

This folder contains XML files that define marker sets for use in OpenSim simulations.

#### 🧩 What is a marker set?
A marker set in OpenSim specifies:
- The **name** of each marker.
- The **body segment** it is attached to (e.g., `pelvis`, `femur_r`, etc.).
- The **location** (3D coordinates in meters) of the marker relative to its segment.
- Additional visual and simulation parameters (e.g., visibility, fixed status).

Each `<Marker>` in the XML file looks like this:

```xml
<Marker name="LASIS">
    <body>pelvis</body>
    <location>0.02 0.03 -0.128</location>
    <fixed>true</fixed>
    ...
</Marker>
```
#### 🛠️ What can be modified?

You are free to:

- **Add or remove markers**.
- **Rename markers**, as long as the new names are consistent with your other files and scripts.
- **Change the body segment** (`<body>`) the marker is attached to.
- **Change the location** (`<location>`) of a marker to simulate different placements.
- Optionally **adjust visual properties** in the `<VisibleObject>` block (not mandatory for simulation to run correctly).

#### ⚠️ Notes

- If you add or rename markers, make sure to update all scripts and configuration files that reference those names.
- Modifying marker locations is how **simulated displacements** are implemented in this project (e.g., adding markers with suffixes like `_90`, `_180`, etc.).

## 📁 example_model_files

This folder contains OpenSim musculoskeletal model files used in the pipeline. In this project, we use the `gait2354_simbody.osim` model.

### 📄 Model Used

- **Model:** `gait2354_simbody.osim`
- **Structure:** Includes a simplified anatomical structure with:
  - A **trunk**
  - A **pelvis**
  - Two **legs** (left and right), each with a thigh, shank, and foot

This model is widely used in gait analysis and comes with predefined joint definitions, degrees of freedom, and marker attachment sites.



### 🛠️ What Can Be Modified?

You are free to customize various aspects of the model, depending on your experimental needs:

| Component | What You Can Modify |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Mass properties** | Change the mass, center of mass, and inertia for each segment |
| **Segment geometry** | Modify segment lengths or geometries to match specific populations |
| **Joint limits** | Update the lower and upper bounds of kinematic ranges (e.g., hip flexion range) |
| **Degrees of freedom** | Adjust joint types or add/remove joints if needed |
| **Marker definitions** | Add or reposition markers for use with different marker sets |
| **Muscle/tendon models** | While not used in this project, these components can also be adapted if you're doing forward dynamics or muscle-driven simulations |



### ⚠️ Notes

- Any changes to the model should be made with care, especially when modifying joint definitions or coordinate systems, as this can affect IK and scaling accuracy.
- Be consistent: if you change marker names or structure, update your `.xml` marker set files and associated scripts accordingly.
- If the results of the **inverse kinematics** seem weird (e.g., limited motion, unrealistic postures), it may be because the **kinematic boundaries** in the `.osim` model are too narrow. You may need to widen these joint limits to allow the solver to find more realistic solutions.

## 📁 example_osim_setup_files
### 📄 `scaling_setup.xml` – Scaling Setup File

This XML file defines how an OpenSim musculoskeletal model should be scaled to fit a specific subject based on anatomical markers and measurements from a static trial.


#### 🧱 Structure

- **General subject info**
  ```xml
  <mass>, <height>, <age>
  ```
  Used to define subject-specific metadata (can be adjusted for your case).

- **GenericModelMaker**
  ```xml
  <model_file>, <marker_set_file>
  ```
  Specifies the generic (unscaled) model and the marker set to use.

- **ModelScaler**  
  This section:
  - Defines the **scaling logic** using marker pairs and segment-specific measurements.
  - Uses `<MeasurementSet>` containing several `<Measurement>` elements.
  - Each measurement has:
    - A `<MarkerPairSet>` defining which markers determine the scaling.
    - A `<BodyScaleSet>` specifying which body segments to scale.

- **ScaleSet (optional)**  
  Allows hardcoding of custom scaling factors for specific segments.

- **MarkerPlacer**
  This section:
  - Applies inverse kinematics to place markers correctly on the scaled model.
  - Contains `<IKTaskSet>` to specify which markers and coordinates should be prioritized or ignored.
  - Outputs a `.mot` file representing the static pose and the scaled `.osim` model.


#### 🛠️ What Can Be Modified?

You are free to:

- Change `mass`, `height`, and `age` values to fit your subject.
- Update `<model_file>` and `<marker_set_file>` to reference your own model and marker set.
- Add, remove, or modify any `<Measurement>` or `<MarkerPair>` block to adjust how body segments are scaled.
- Customize `<BodyScale>` and enable/disable scaling along the X, Y, or Z axes.
- Change marker task weights in `<IKMarkerTask>` to give more importance to specific markers.
- Use or ignore specific coordinates with `<IKCoordinateTask>` by adjusting the `<apply>` flags.


#### ⚠️ Notes

- If the model scaling results are unrealistic (e.g., abnormal segment dimensions), make sure your `<MeasurementSet>` definitions match the actual distances in your calibration data.
- Marker weights affect how well the virtual model aligns with the actual marker data.
- Marker names and segment references must exactly match those in the marker set file and the OpenSim model.

| `load_average_and_save_trc_bis` | Loads multiple TRC files, averages the marker data across all files, and saves the result to a new TRC file with a consistent header and marker order. |



### 📄 `opensim_kinematics_utils.py`

This module provides utility functions for creating, modifying, and executing OpenSim XML configurations for scaling, inverse kinematics, and point kinematics workflows. It also includes tools for marker processing and TRC reconstruction from analysis results.


| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `update_scaling_xml` | Updates a scaling setup XML file by replacing parameters like mass, height, marker files, and model output paths. |
| `generate_ik_setup_xml` | Creates an Inverse Kinematics XML setup file with marker and coordinate tasks, using model and marker input files. |
| `generate_pointkin_xml_from_marker_file` | Builds an AnalyzeTool XML file with `PointKinematics` analyses for each marker defined in a marker XML file. |
| `generate_trc_from_stos` | Reads multiple `.sto` files from a `PointKinematics` analysis and compiles them into a single `.trc` file. |
| `add_marker_to_opensim_file` | Adds one or more markers to an existing OpenSim marker set XML, including geometry and visualization settings. |
| `deplacer_markers` | Applies translations to specified markers in a marker XML file by adjusting their coordinate values. |
| `extract_markers_from_xml` | Parses an OpenSim marker XML file and returns a dictionary of marker names and their coordinates. |
| `scaling` | Runs the full OpenSim scaling workflow: converts static C3D to TRC, updates XML config, runs ScaleTool, and manages output. |
| `inverse_kinematics` | Executes the Inverse Kinematics tool based on motion and calibration data, producing a `.mot` file. |
| `point_kinematics` | Runs a PointKinematics analysis for specified markers and converts the result into a usable `.trc` file. |



### 📄 `pipeline_utils.py`

This module provides high-level orchestration utilities to simulate, displace, correct, and analyze marker sets using OpenSim pipelines. It automates batch processing of marker perturbation experiments for both real and simulated data.


| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `run_displacement_pipeline_opensim` | Runs a pipeline to simulate marker displacement on OpenSim-generated data (ground truth), generate noisy marker sets, perform scaling and IK, and assess results through point kinematics. |
| `run_displacement_correction_pipeline` | Averages multiple displaced static TRC files into a corrected marker file, rescales a model, and reprocesses dynamic trials using the corrected calibration for evaluation. |
| `run_displacement_pipeline` | Executes a full marker displacement pipeline using real C3D data: generates displaced marker combinations, performs scaling and IK on both real and optionally simulated data, and computes point kinematics for evaluation. |
